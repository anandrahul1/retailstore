# Microservices Online Retail Store - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive **microservices-based online retail store** with event-driven architecture, containerized services, and modern cloud-native deployment on AWS. This is a production-ready MVP designed to handle 20 concurrent users with the ability to scale.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Microservices Design**
- **6 Independent Services**: User Management, Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, Order Management, Payment, and Notification
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Using Amazon EventBridge and SQS for asynchronous processing
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data with DynamoDB tables
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and security

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: Python 3.11 + FastAPI + DynamoDB
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- **Containerization**: Docker + AWS Fargate
- **Event Processing**: EventBridge + SQS
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + X-Ray

## 💰 Cost Analysis (MVP - 20 Users)

### **Monthly Cost Breakdown**
| Service | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| AWS Fargate | $36.50 | 1 task, 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM |
| Application Load Balancer | $18.50 | 24/7 operation |
| VPC & Networking | $45.00 | NAT Gateway primary cost |
| CloudWatch | $5.00 | Basic monitoring |
| API Gateway | $0.70 | 200K requests/month |
| CloudFront | $1.20 | 10GB transfer/month |
| DynamoDB | $0.63 | Pay-per-request |
| Other Services | $1.34 | S3, SQS, EventBridge |
| **Total** | **$107.87/month** | **~$1,295/year** |

### **Free Tier Benefits (First 12 Months)**
